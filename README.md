# DatabaseSpelunking
 A collection of scripts to find stuff in relational databases.

Most of the scripts are SQL, and use the Microsoft SQL Server SYS tables. The names are self explanitory. 

Most of the SQL scripts can be converted to work on the INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables for other database engines. A script is provided to show the INFORMATION_SCHEMA objects.

One of the scripts is PowerShell, and is used to find a specific table on a SQL Server instance.
